            <h1>About The Film</h1>
        <p>John Eaden has been keeping bees for over 9 years. In this short film, John (with help from his assistant Rachel) talks to us about just how remarkable our tiny, buzzing, neighbours actually are, the critical role they play in the natural world and what the public can do to support them.</p>
            <br>
        <p> JAR Media and the Manchester & District Beekeeping Association are proud to bring you this short educational video on Manchester's very own mascot.
